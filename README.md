# Data analysis of bike sharing

In this project I performed basic data analysis and tried to find answers for the questions below:
  <li> Identify active and inactive stations
  <li>Identify the most used station
  <li>Identify stations with bikes excess and bikes shortage
  <li>Visualize geographic locations of the stations
  <li>Calculate distances between individual stations
  <li>Analyze durations of trips, their central tendencies and outliers

  <li>Visualize demand for bike renting through time.
  <li>Identify causes of demand fluctuation.
  <li>Determine possible influence of weather on bike renting
  <li>Determine if demand for bike renting is higher on weekdays of weekends
    
    
  Analysis were made with Python and  [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/OndrejVejvoda/engeto-python-project/blob/main/edinburgh_bikes_analysis.ipynb). The most used libraries were pandas, numpy and matplotlib with seaborn.
